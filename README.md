# codevideo

The CLI tool for generating CodeVideos.

## npm installation

The npm wrapper installs only the native binary for your operating system and architecture:

```shell
npx @fullstackcraftllc/codevideo-cli doctor
npx @fullstackcraftllc/codevideo-cli install-browser # only when Chrome is not already installed
npx @fullstackcraftllc/codevideo-cli --version
```

Rendering requires Node.js 20 or newer, Chrome/Chromium, and FFmpeg. Chrome is detected from `CODEVIDEO_CHROME_PATH`, the managed CodeVideo browser cache, or common system locations. FFmpeg is resolved from `CODEVIDEO_FFMPEG_PATH` and then `PATH`.

The wrapper supports these optional runtime locations:

- `CODEVIDEO_PUPPETEER_RUNNER_PATH`
- `CODEVIDEO_WORK_DIR`
- `CODEVIDEO_LOG_DIR`
- `CODEVIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR`
- `CODEVIDEO_BROWSER_CACHE_DIR`

## Source installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/codevideo/codevideo
cd codevideo
cd puppeteer-runner
npm install
npx @puppeteer/browsers install chrome@latest
```

Make a note of what was installed in `puppeteer-runner/chrome` - you'll need to update the path in `puppeteer-runner/recordVideoV3.js` on line 73.

Then build the Go binary:

```shell
cd ../..
go build -o codevideo
```

Very importantly, create a `.env` file with your Elevenlabs API key:

```env
# Copy from .env.example and fill in your values
ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your-elevenlabs-api-key
# ... other configuration options
```

You should be ready to start using the CodeVideo CLI!

If you don't have an Elevenlabs account - we're working on a solution with htgo-tts and other providers.

## Usage

With actions:

```shell
./codevideo -p "$(cat data/actions.json)"
```

Note: if you are using `zsh` and get the error `zsh: event not found: \`, try deactivating history expansion with `set +o histexpand` and try the command again.

If all works well, you should see the following final output:

```shell
Detected project type: Actions
/> CodeVideo generation in progress...
[==========================] 100% 
✅ CodeVideo successfully generated and saved to CodeVideo-2025-03-21-18-58-47.mp4
```

As an alternative, paste your actions, lesson, or course JSON into `data/actions.json`, `data/lesson.json`, or `data/course.json` respectively - all types are accepted.

With actions:

```shell
./codevideo -p "$(cat data/actions.json)"
```

With a lesson:

```shell
./codevideo -p "$(cat data/lesson.json)"
```

With a course:

```shell
./codevideo -p "$(cat data/course.json)"
```

## Complex CLI Example - Actions, With Given Output Path, and Open when Done

```shell
./codevideo -p "$(cat data/actions.json)" -o codevideo-intro.mp4 --open
```

## Video Configuration Options

You can specify the orientation and resolution of the video with the `-r` or `--resolution` and `-o` or `--orientation` flags, respectively. The default resolution is `1080p` and the default orientation is `landscape`.

## IDE Configuration Options

All React IDE props from the `CodeVideoIDE` can be passed in via the `-c` or `--config` to a config.json file. (See `data/config.json` for an example)

```shell
./codevideo -p "$(cat data/actions.json)" -c data/config.json
```

## Server usage:

Simply pass the `-m serve` parameter to the command to start the server:

```shell
./codevideo -m serve
```

To run in the background use `nohup` or similar:

```shell
nohup ./codevideo -m serve &
```

This will watch for manifest files in /tmp/v3/new and process them as they arrive. The server will output the video to the `output` folder.

## Docker

The render worker ships as a multi-arch image (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`) on
Docker Hub as `fullstackcraft/codevideo-cli`. CI builds and pushes it on every `v*`
tag — see `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`.

### As the API render worker (serve mode)

The [codevideo-api](https://github.com/codevideo/codevideo-api) compose stack pulls
this image and runs it in serve mode. It's a filesystem-queue worker — no published
port — that shares the API's render queue through a bind mount and reads its secrets
(S3, Clerk, Slack, Mailjet) from the central `.env`:

```yaml
  codevideo-cli:
    image: fullstackcraft/codevideo-cli:0.0.8   # pin to a release
    restart: always
    init: true
    shm_size: "1gb"
    volumes:
      - ./tmp/v3/:/work/tmp/v3/
    env_file: .env
    environment:
      - CODEVIDEO_WORK_DIR=/work/tmp/v3
```

### Build it yourself

```shell
docker build -t fullstackcraft/codevideo-cli:dev .
```

### One-off CLI render (no server)

Mount an env file and an output dir, then pass actions directly (this overrides the
default `-m serve`):

```shell
docker run --rm \
  -e CODEVIDEO_OUTPUT_DIR=/app/output \
  -v "$(pwd)/.env:/app/.env" \
  -v "$(pwd)/output:/app/output" \
  fullstackcraft/codevideo-cli:dev \
  -p "[{\"name\":\"author-speak-before\",\"value\":\"Let's learn how to use the print function in Python!\"}]"
```

## For Developers

You can update the Gatsby static site by replacing the `public` folder within `cli/staticserver`. We recommend you use the `example` site within the `example` folder of the [`@fullstackcraftllc/codevideo-ide-react`](https://github.com/codevideo/codevideo-ide-react) repository.

Everything in the `public` folder is treated as an embedded Go resource and served by the server.

## CodeVideo Studio

Build your actions JSON in the [CodeVideo Studio](https://studio.codevideo.io)!

## Deployment

Set `NPM_TOKEN` as a repository variable in Github.

Then run the following command to deploy:

```shell
go test ./...

cd npm
npm ci
npm run release:check
```

```shell
git tag -a v0.0.7 -m "Release codevideo-cli 0.0.7"
git push origin main
git push origin v0.0.7
```
