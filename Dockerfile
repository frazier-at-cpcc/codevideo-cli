# codevideo-cli render worker image (multi-stage).
#
# Build stage compiles the Go CLI with the exact toolchain go.mod pins (1.26) —
# don't rely on the runtime image's packaged Go, which lags. Runtime stage is
# zenika/alpine-chrome:with-puppeteer (Chromium + Node + Puppeteer) plus ffmpeg
# (the webm -> mp4 step shells out to it). Published to Docker Hub as
# fullstackcraft/codevideo-cli and pulled by the codevideo-api compose stack.

# ---- build: compile the static Go binary --------------------------------------

RUN apk add --no-cache git

# Go deps first for layer caching.
COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

# CGO off -> a fully static binary that runs on the Alpine runtime base. VERSION
# is injected by release builds (consumed by main.go's `var version`).

# ---- runtime: Chromium + Node/Puppeteer + ffmpeg ------------------------------

# `node <execDir>/puppeteer-runner/recordVideoV3.js`, so it must sit next to the

# Runtime config for the containerized serve worker:
#   CODEVIDEO_CHROME_PATH - resolveChromeExecutable() honors this first, so pin
#     the base image's Chromium instead of relying on PATH resolution.
#   CODEVIDEO_WORK_DIR    - the shared render queue the API bind-mounts in. Go's
#     WorkFolder()/VideoFolder() and the --manifest-path/--output-webm args
#     passed to the Node runner all derive from it, keeping both sides in sync.

# (:7001) servers it starts are reached only by its own Puppeteer over
# localhost, so nothing is published.
